# El Paso Road Prioritization System Application

### Hi there! This repository is for a final project for MUSA 611 at UPenn in collaboration with the MUSA Practicum. 
####The MUSA Practicum project was completed by Kristin Chang, Sisun Cheng, and Jenna Epstein with the help of Alex Hoffman at the El Paso Capital Improvements Department and MUSA Faculty: Michael Fichman, Matt Harris, and Mjumbe Poe.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a web application for our client in the MUSA practicum, the Capital Improvement Department's Planning Division in the City of El Paso, Texas. The client is interested in improving their system for deciding where and how to allocate capital improvement funds for road repairs. Presently, this is determined using a Pavement Condition Index (PCI). In 2018, a private contractor assigned each road segment under the city's jurisidiction a PCI score based on a digital image scan. With this knowledge, we can infer that PCI scores are heavily dependent on physical conditions of the road such as potholes, cracks, or bumps. Whenever the city receives a request for a repair, they confirm that the PCI score for that road segment is low, and fulfill the request. <br>

The current decision-making process is reactive and can be made more proactive by incorporating other factors to consider such as the population that the roads are servicing, the level of traffic congestion, or how a road repair may contribute to a Vision Zero or other Safe Streets city plan. The web application accomplishes this by allowing users to view road segments by PCI score overlayed on data layers of Equity, Road Safety, Traffic Congestion, and Flood Risk. These layers were chosen in collaboration with our client per a community survey sent out by the city.
